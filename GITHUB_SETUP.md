## Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash

# SSH (recommended if you have SSH keys set up)

git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/zatca-invoice-creator.git

# OR HTTPS (works for everyone)

git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zatca-invoice-creator.git

```bash

### Step 3: Push to GitHub
